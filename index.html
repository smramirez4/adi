      <h2>Happy Anniversary Adi!</h2>
      <p>
        Happy 6th anniversary for the both of us my adi! ðŸ’–ðŸŽ‰ I canâ€™t believe weâ€™ve made it this far.
        So here comes my quiet long speech hehe i love you.
        <br><br>
        First, I want to say thank you for everything youâ€™ve done for me. Iâ€™m always grateful to have you as my bff, boyfriend, husband, my ride-or-die, and my forever partner in crime ðŸ˜ˆ. 
        To be honest, I donâ€™t know what my future would look like without you in it. Youâ€™re a part of all my future plans. I always imagined to have a peaceful life with you and start a family (I told you this). 
        I wish we could meet soon because I badly want to embrace you in my arms and kiss you (of course, to have hanky-panky as well ðŸ¤£).
        <br><br>
        Kidding aside, thank you for always understanding my personality and for keeping up with my attitude. Although itâ€™s hard to understand sometimes or â€” often. 
        Itâ€™s funny because even though I donâ€™t finish my sentence you still get what Iâ€™m trying to say. 
        I appreciate you for going along with all my craziness as well, likewise ðŸ˜‰. 
        I wish I could hug you right now and celebrate our day outside but too bad we canâ€™t because we are miles away from each other.
        <br><br>
        Looking back on everything weâ€™ve been through, I realized how patient you have been with me. 
        I truly appreciate how forgiving you are with me, even though I can be insensitive with the things I say. 
        Iâ€™m sorry for all the times that I hurt you adi. Iâ€™m sorry for the pain I inflicted to your heart ðŸ¥º. 
        I will change myself for you so that I canâ€™t hurt you again. I want to be the best version of myself. 
        I donâ€™t know how am I going to erase the things I said that are stuck inside your head but I will assure you that I will give my very best to give you the assurance that could bring you a peace of mind. 
        Alright Iâ€™ll stop apologizing. Itâ€™s already in the past and I donâ€™t want to ruin our special day by saying apologies.
        <br><br>
        Again, thank you for spending these 6 wonderful years with me and many more years together. 
        My wish for our relationship is that we continue to grow together, cherish each other, and spend our lives together. 
        I hope that through all our ups and downs, in sickness and in health, for richer or poorer and till death do us part weâ€™ll always be together. 
        I love you with all that I am, my loving and incredibly understanding husband ðŸ˜˜.
      </p>
      <p class="closing">Forever yours,<br>ðŸ’–</p>
